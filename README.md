# Projects
#### The Theory of Modeling Pandemic Severity
Using the severity of COVID-19 as real world example, [this paper](https://github.com/TzipHoro/QC_MATH_342/tree/master/modeling%20essay) covers the theory of supervised learning, specification, linear modelling, error metrics, validation, and model selection.

#### Modeling Apartment Sale Prices in Queens
The goal of [this research](https://github.com/TzipHoro/QC_MATH_342/tree/master/final%20project) is to create a predictive model for the sale price of apartments in Queens, New York. Using data on the Queens housing market between February 2016 and February 2017,
three predictive models were made via the OLS, Regression Tree, and Random Forest algorithms.
By identifying key explanatory features, the three models are obtained and discussed in detail.
