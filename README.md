I am a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and experience in data science research. As a hard working, analytical, and self-motivated individual with a record of academic accomplishments and proven leadership and communication skills, I aim to uncover and explain the world's nuances through data science.

# Projects
#### The Theory of Modeling Pandemic Severity
Using the severity of COVID-19 as real world example, [this paper](https://github.com/TzipHoro/QC_MATH_342/tree/master/modeling%20essay) covers the theory of supervised learning, specification, linear modelling, error metrics, validation, and model selection.

#### Modeling Apartment Sale Prices in Queens, New York
The goal of [this research](https://github.com/TzipHoro/QC_MATH_342/tree/master/final%20project) is to create a predictive model for the sale price of apartments in Queens, New York. Using data on the Queens housing market between February 2016 and February 2017,
three predictive models were made via the OLS, Regression Tree, and Random Forest algorithms.
By identifying key explanatory features, the three models are obtained and discussed in detail. 

#### Obesity in the United States: A Report on the Contributing Factors to One of the Nation’s Leading Heath Epidemics
The United States has the highest obesity rate among developed nations and is ranked twelfth in the world. Obesity prevalence is a growing concern that must addressed. It affects the health of the people as well as the economy. Previous studies have found that policy intervention helps reduce the rate of obesity, but none have pinpointed which policies are most effective. By way of two econometric models, this paper analyzes key factors of obesity prevalence such as, race/ethnicity, food consumption expenditure, income, and unemployment rates across the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the year of 2017, to identify causes of differences between state obesity rates and thereby find areas in which policies can be made. The models show that the percentage of the state population that identifies as black and state unemployment rate increases obesity prevalence while food consumption expenditure and income decrease obesity prevalence. Using these results, further policies can be implemented to help combat the growing epidemic.

#### Incorporating Association Patterns into Manifold Clustering for Enabling Predictive Analytics
The goal of this research is to develop a predictive analytics technique based on manifold clustering of mixed data type. In this research, we explore the concept of statistically significant association patterns to induce an initial partition on data for deriving manifolds. Manifolds are hyperplanes embedded in low dimensions. The advantage of this novel technique is a bootstrap on data clusters that reveals statistical associations from the information-theoretic perspective. As an illustration, the proposed technique is applied to a real data set of diabetes patients. An assessment on the proposed technique is performed to investigate the effect of bootstrap based on association patterns. Results of the preliminary study demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed technique to real-world data.
